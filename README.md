### Astonia 3

#### Preface

Astonia 3 is a small MMO. It has all the stuff a fantasy role-playing game needs (character development with attributes, skills and spells, quests, equipment and monsters), and it can handle maybe 500 players online at once per shard. A realistic limit for the number of shards is around 50. With some investments into the database server hardware more is possible.

Astonia 3 is the successor to my hobby project Mercenaries of Astonia 2. It was developed mostly by me for Intent Software. Intent Software was so kind to allow me to release the project to the public.

Requirements

#### Server

The server needs Linux, MySQL development libraries and 32 bit gcc environment to compile. To run it needs a MySQL server on the same host.

The three files ending in .sql need to be imported into the MySQL server. The MySQL user root needs the password set to the one contained in the file MYSQLPASSWORD.

To create accounts, use the command line tool "create_account" and to create characters use "create_character".

Check the script "start" for an example on how to start the server. A multi-area server will need the chatserver running as well.

#### Client

You will need the free Borland C++ 5.5 command line tools (available below)

Also requires libpng and zlib, but both are part of the client source code package.

#### Downloads

You can find the following items at the original developers Astonia pages
